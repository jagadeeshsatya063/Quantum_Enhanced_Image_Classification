# Quantum-Enhanced Image Classification

## Overview
This project explores the integration of adaptive quantum optimization into deep learning for image classification. It compares classical CNNs (Adam optimizer) with hybrid quantum-classical models using adaptive quantum enhancement, focusing on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Features
- Classical CNN and ResNet-20 architectures for CIFAR-10
- Hybrid quantum-classical model with adaptive quantum enhancement
- Step learning rate scheduler with customizable parameters
- Automatic saving of results and plots in organized directories
- Evaluation metrics: accuracy, F1 score, recall, confusion matrix
- Easy-to-read training logs and comparison plots

## Setup
1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Download CIFAR-10 dataset:**
   The scripts will automatically download CIFAR-10 to the `data/` directory if not present.

## Usage
- **Train Adam-only model:**
  ```bash
  python train_adam.py
  ```
- **Train Hybrid (Quantum-Enhanced) model:**
  ```bash
  python train_hybrid.py
  ```
- **Compare results:**
  ```bash
  python compare_adam_hybrid.py
  ```

All results and plots will be saved in the `results/` directory.

## Results & Visualizations

Below are example visualizations generated by the training and comparison scripts. These plots are saved in the `results/images/` directory.

- **Adam Training Results**
